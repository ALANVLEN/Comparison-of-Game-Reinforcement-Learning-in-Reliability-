# Comparison-of-Game-Reinforcement-Learning-in-Reliability-
Comparing and Contrasting three different kinds of popular reinforcement learning (Value based, Policy based and actor critic) in its reliability with various parameters by analysis its reward, tendency and designed metrics. Analyzing the strength and weakness of the algorithms based on the result.
However, this project is still in progress, so detailed report would be update later.
